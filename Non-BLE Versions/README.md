# Non Bluetooth LE versions of the belt and collar sketches

The Arduino sketches in this folder are the predecessors to the BLE Beetle versions. 
They do not have the direct color control that the BLE offers, nor all the animations.

Animation mode and color are selected by resetting or power-cycling the control board.

These do include an actual low-power sleep mode in the cycle of patterns. Wake the processor back up by resetting again.
